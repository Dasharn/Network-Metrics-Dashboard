This repository contains code for a WebSocket server and a React app that communicates with the server that I contributed to

## WebSocket Server

The WebSocket server is implemented using Node.js and the `websocket` library. It establishes a WebSocket connection with clients and sends the current timestamp every 100 milliseconds.
